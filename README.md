# PropertyEditorBoilerPlate

This is a work in progress test for making packages easier. The idea is to provide a boilerplate for an Umbraco Property Editor that can be forked for new Property Editor projects and quickly get you up to speed.

## Contribute

We'd like to have the best possible boilerplate for new Property Editors, so please contribute to this project by either submitting an issue or sending a Pull Request with improvements!
